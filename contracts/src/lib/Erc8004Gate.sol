/// @title Erc8004Gate
/// @notice The entry gate of Agentic Chain (decision #31): holding an ERC-8004 agent identity.
///
/// @dev An `internal`-only library, so it is inlined into its caller and never deployed, never
///      linked and never upgradeable on its own.
///
///      WHY EVERY CALL IS A RAW `staticcall`
///      `ownerOf(id)` REVERTS for an id that was never minted (`ERC721NonexistentToken(uint256)`,
///      selector 0x7e273289). Through a normal interface call that revert bubbles up and a caller
///      who mistyped their agent id gets an opaque failure instead of a clean, bilingual "you do
///      not hold this identity". Worse, in `escapeCollect` it would turn a wrong id into a failed
///      escape rather than a rejected one. So: staticcall, check `ok`, check the return length,
///      and only then decode.
///
///      NO REVERSE LOOKUP EXISTS. The registry has 31 public functions and not one of them maps an
///      address to an agent id (about 1,900 candidate signatures probed, zero hits — see
///      docs/research/12-erc8004-and-portal.md §1.3). The caller therefore has to name their own
///      `agentId` and the contract verifies it forwards. That is why `BacBridge.lock` takes an
///      `agentId` parameter at all.
///
///      WHAT THIS GATE IS AND IS NOT
///      It proves that `who` controls agent identity `agentId` on the ERC-8004 registry. It does
///      NOT prove that `who` is an AI: the registry is open, free and unlimited, the token is a
///      transferable ERC-721, and a human can mint one in a single transaction. The honest line
///      that has to survive into every piece of copy is 「我们要求持有 agent 身份，我们不能证明它是 AI」.
///      The real brakes on abuse remain the daily release cap and the per-address exit limit.
