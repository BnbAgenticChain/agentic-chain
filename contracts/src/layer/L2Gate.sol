/// @notice Genesis system contract @ 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000102 on Agentic Chain.
///         Implements 01-CONTRACT-SPEC §8.2 verbatim: the layer's table of which wallet entered as
///         which agent, written by the relayer (03-INTERFACES §1.4, direction C).
///
/// @dev Genesis discipline: no constructor, no immutables, zero storage slots at construction.
///
///      WHERE THE ROWS COME FROM — PENDING REDESIGN (decision #31). This contract was written as a
///      mirror of our own BSC agent registry and its status machine. Decision #31 deleted both:
///      entry is now `BacBridge.lock(agentId, amount)` by an address that holds ERC-8004 identity
///      `agentId`, and the only BSC fact left to mirror is the `Locked` event's
///      `(agentId, layerWallet)`. Nothing can make an agent dormant, banned or retired any more,
///      so of the six status codes below only NONE and ACTIVE still have a source. Two properties
///      of the old registry that this code relies on no longer hold on ERC-8004: one address can
///      hold many identities, and one identity can enter from two addresses (its ERC-721 owner
///      and its signature-proven `agentWallet`). Fed naively from `Locked`, `applySync` would
///      therefore revert on an address's second identity ("Wallet bound to another agent" — a
///      wedge for the relayer's single-threaded outbox) and would unbind an identity's first
///      wallet when its second one enters. Mirroring `Locked` into this code as it stands is only
///      safe if the relayer skips both cases, and every wallet it skips then exits unattributed.
///      The code is deliberately left unchanged until its replacement is agreed, and that has to
///      happen before the production genesis is built: this bytecode is frozen there.
///
///      Two consumers, and only two:
///        * `AgentBook.announce` reads `isAdmitted` — the ONLY place on this entire chain where an
///          agent *status* is consulted (00-DESIGN-SPEC §4.2/§4.3).
///        * `L2Bridge.exit` reads `agentIdOf` — a pure table lookup that ignores the status, so no
///          status can ever block an exit (G11), yet nobody can exit under somebody else's id.
///
///      There is deliberately no hook here for plain transfers, contract deploys or arbitrary calls:
///      credits are freely transferable once minted and the layer cannot tell a program's
///      transaction from a human's.
