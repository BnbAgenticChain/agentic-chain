///                           any upgrade reach it like everything else here (decision #29).
///           - `buybackBac`  BAC bought back on the market with the bridge's tax BNB. This is the
///                           ONLY bucket an exit can ever be paid from.

///         (`_payExitBac`), and the invariant suite proves no NON-owner call path can pay an exit
///         out of `lockedBac`. Owner withdrawals are exempt by design and counted on their own.
///
///         MONEY MODEL (model A = STOCK of the buyback simulation, artifacts/sim/RESULTS-buyback.md):
///         BNB arrives from `BacTaxRouter`'s tax split, is spent on a bounded, permissionless,
///         scheduled buyback, and the BAC it buys piles up in `buybackBac`. An exit locks a
///         BAC-denominated share of that stock at claim time (M1) — `lockedBacAmt = credits *
///         free / outstanding` with `free = buybackBac - owedTotal` — and that debt is released
///         through a single O(1) release index (M4, `ReleasePoint`): each pot releases the same
///         fraction of every address's not-yet-released owed. Because the debt and the asset are
///         the same unit, `owedTotal <= buybackBac` holds by construction: the bridge cannot
///         become insolvent by a price move. An exit never touches the market, so its price
///         impact is exactly zero.
///
///         HONEST COST (decision #24b): taking BAC out instead of BNB costs roughly 4% more in
///         total — the buyback pays ~2% buy tax plus slippage, and an exiter who then wants BNB
///         pays ~2% sell tax plus slippage. The exiter is strictly worse off; the only beneficiary
///         is the buy pressure. Nothing in this contract makes an exit cheaper.
///
///         ANCHOR WAIT (decisions #18/#25): the anchor's waiting period is 120 seconds and is
///         called a wait, never a challenge. At 120 s there is effectively no human reaction
///         window: the only remaining brakes are the daily release cap and `pause()`, so the
///         watchdog has to be an always-on automated process. `revokeEpochOwed` exists because at
///         that speed `pause()` alone would only delay a loss, not stop it.
///
///         ENTRY GATE (decision #31): entry requires holding an ERC-8004 agent identity on the
///         registry named by `identityRegistry`. We deleted our own registry and its timed
///         signature challenge for it. Be exact about what this buys: ERC-8004 is BNB Chain's
///         published standard with a real ecosystem and a reputation trail, and that is its whole
