/// @notice The BSC-side deployment of Agentic Chain, in the order written out below. THIS
///         header is the reference for the deploy order; the operator runbook (not in this repo) walks through
///         the same steps. The step numbers (4)-(10) are the historical numbering of
///         docs/01-CONTRACT-SPEC.md section 9, but that section still describes the deleted
///         factory / VaultPortal / AgentRegistry path (library, registry, a 4-argument bridge
///         without a proxy, vault factory, setVaultSink) and must NOT be followed.
///
/// @dev  DRY RUN IS THE DEFAULT. Running this without `--broadcast` only simulates; forge
///       sends nothing. Broadcasting needs BOTH of these, and the script reverts if the
///       flag is present without the env var:
///
///         1. the CLI flag        --broadcast
///         2. the env var         BAC_BROADCAST=I_HAVE_READ_SECTION_9
///            ("section 9" means the steps listed in this header, not the stale spec section)
///
///       Dry run (this is what you normally want):
///         forge script script/DeployBac.s.sol:DeployBac --fork-url "$BSC_RPC_URL" --sender 0x<deployer>
///
///       There is no scripted local rehearsal for this path yet: scripts/anvil_rehearsal.sh and
///       scripts/sim_launch.sh still drive the deleted factory / VaultPortal path (docs/04 marks
///       them stale). test/BacForkLaunch.t.sol reproduces this script's order on a mainnet fork,
///       and a dry run of this script against a fork is the rehearsal.
///
///       What gets deployed, and by whom (decision #30 removed the library, the vault factory,
///       the vault implementation and the beacon - there is no linked library left to deploy):
///         (3) - GONE. Decision #31 deleted our own `AgentRegistry`: the bridge's entry gate is
///             now the ERC-8004 Identity Registry, which is already deployed and which we only
///             read. Nothing to deploy, nothing to own, nothing to verify on BscScan.
///         (4) ChainAnchor(predicted BacBridge PROXY, relayer, admin, vetoKey, initialCirculating)
///         (5) ValidatorStaking(T, anchor, admin)
///         (6) BacNodeFund(T, nodeFundOwner)
///         (7a) BacBridge implementation - no constructor arguments. Its constructor disables
///             initializers and deploys `BacBridgeExtension` (with the IMPLEMENTATION's nonce,
///             not the deployer's), so this step costs the deployer exactly one nonce.
///         (7b) ERC1967Proxy(implementation, initialize(owner, T, ERC-8004 identity registry,
///             anchor, watchdog, flap Portal, PancakeSwap V2 router)) - initialised inside the
///             proxy's own constructor, so there is no block in which an uninitialised proxy
///             exists for someone else to initialise. It MUST land on the address (4) was given.
///         (8) ChainAnchor.setValidatorStaking(5)        - one-shot, deployer only
///         (10) BacTaxRouter(T, bridge PROXY, nodeFund) - the address we type into the launch
///             form as the beneficiary. It must be deployed LAST, because its constructor
///             staticcalls `bacToken()` on both downstreams and refuses to exist unless both are
///             already bound to the same `T` (the bare implementation answers address(0), so it
///             cannot be wired in by mistake).
///
///       Nonces, relative to the deployer's nonce `n` at step (4):
///         anchor n, staking n+1, nodeFund n+2, implementation n+3, PROXY n+4, (setValidatorStaking
///         n+5, a call), router n+6. The script predicts the proxy from `n + 4` and refuses to go on
///         if it lands anywhere else. Send nothing else from the deployer while this runs.
///
///       OWNER POWERS (decision #29). The proxy's owner - `BAC_BRIDGE_OWNER`, default the deployer
///       (decision #33: "一直用部署钱包") - can upgrade the bridge and withdraw its whole pool at any
///       time, with no timelock. 项目方可以随时升级桥合约、修改规则，并可随时取走桥池中的全部资金。
///       That sentence is `BacBridge.OWNER_POWER_NOTICE`, and this script refuses to finish unless
///       the deployed bridge says it word for word.
///

///       with `Portal.lockSalt` (decision #35: salt 0xef6c...0b2af7 locked to the deployment
///       wallet, T = 0xA97452d175679B2bF5F25a9a382D22aff39b7777). It is an immutable of (5)(6)(10)
///       and a write-once storage slot of (7b): if the launch uses a different salt, all of them
///       are scrap. The script refuses to run if `T` already has code.
///
///       PREFLIGHT ITEMS 1 AND 3 (docs/04 §1.3), BEFORE ANYTHING IS SENT. An env var is a cached
///       value, and every post-deploy check compares the deployed contracts with that same value,
///       so a one-character typo in BAC_TOKEN_PREDICTED would pass all of them and bind every
///       immutable to the wrong token (review finding, 2026-09-23; forge's `envAddress` does not
///       even enforce the EIP-55 checksum). So before `startBroadcast`, `_preflightToken`
///       re-derives `T` on the spot:
///         - on BSC mainnet, `T` must equal the decision #35 constant, AND recomputing the Flap
///           clone address from the locked salt (Portal + the TOKEN_TAXED_V3 implementation, the
///           Portal's own CREATE2 formula) must give the same `T`, AND `Portal.getSaltLock` must
///           show that salt locked to BAC_LAUNCHER for tokenVersion 6 (TOKEN_TAXED_V3), which is
///           the lock the launch needs;
///         - on any other chain the same two recomputations run when BAC_LAUNCH_SALT is set
///           (with BAC_FLAP_TOKEN_IMPL, default the mainnet implementation) and are skipped with a
///           printed warning otherwise.
///
///       Step (11) (the launch, through the PLAIN Portal's `newTokenV6` with `beneficiary` =
